# SHIP — error-handling-griller (advisory roll-up)

`/pharn-dev-ship` gated chain. **Where the run ended:** GATE 2 (post-review human decision) — reached
cleanly; no RED-verdict STOP.

## Stages that ran, in order, with the structural verdict read at each

| stage                | verdict read (FLOOR)                                 | result                               | proceed?               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `/pharn-dev-plan`    | human approval (GATE 1)                              | approved as written                  | ✓                      |
| `/pharn-dev-grill`   | none (advisory by design — gates nothing)            | 2 minor findings                     | ✓ (carried into build) |
| `/pharn-dev-build`   | `node .dev/floor/validate.mjs .` **exit 0**          | **GREEN** (5 caps)                   | ✓                      |
| `/pharn-dev-regress` | `regression-report.json` `.verdict`                  | **`no-regressions`**                 | ✓                      |
| `/pharn-dev-verify`  | `verify-report.json` `.verdict`                      | **`PASS`**                           | ✓                      |
| `/pharn-dev-review`  | none (advisory lenses; floor-first = validate GREEN) | GREEN — 0 blocking, 1 minor advisory | → GATE 2               |

Every "proceed" was read from the named **deterministic verdict** (exit code / `.verdict` enum), never
from a stage's prose or my judgment. The two human gates held: GATE 1 (plan approval) and GATE 2 (this
stop — present, do not act).

## Pointers (cited, not restated — P4)

- Interrogation: `.dev/features/error-handling-griller/GRILL.md` (advisory; 2 minor findings, both carried
  into the build).
- Review: `.dev/features/error-handling-griller/REVIEW.md` (GREEN; 0 floor-gate findings; 1 minor advisory
  anchor-choice finding; a proposed canon lesson on fix #7 concurrency).
- Machine verdicts: `regression-report.json` (`no-regressions`) · `verify-report.json` (`PASS`).

## What landed (for the human's GATE-2 read — not a certification)

A fourth product griller, `pharn-pipeline/grillers/error-handling/error-handling.md` (`role: griller`,
`enforces: [P7]`), + 3 eval cases + 3 expected pairs. Sized **testability-shaped** (floor = griller
membership 3→4 + fixture-pinned present/absent output; **no** new `.dev/floor/` scanner — a keyword
presence-scan is launderable, named+rejected as the P0 disease). Reuses `count-grillers.mjs` +
`check-structural.mjs` unchanged.

## Honest run note (concurrency — surfaced, not hidden)

This run collided **three times** with concurrent PHARN runs (`privacy-griller`, `observability-griller`)
overwriting the shared `.pharn/writes-scope.json`. fix #7 **fail-closed denied** the affected writes (no
corruption); the human paused the other runs and the chain resumed. One foreign untracked file
(`.dev/features/privacy-griller/PLAN.md`) remains in the tree — **not** this feature, not deleted, and
excluded from the regress partition (provably not this build's output). REVIEW.md proposes a canon lesson

- a future increment (per-run scope isolation / a lock) for this real dogfood failure.

## Standing decision — the human's (P0)

Chain ran; the named floor verdicts are as shown (build GREEN · regress `no-regressions` · verify `PASS`;
review advisory-GREEN). **This is NOT a judgment that the increment is good or wise — that is the human's
call at the post-review gate.** `/pharn-dev-ship` did **not** merge, push, commit, or apply any
`PHARN ✓ reviewed` seal.
