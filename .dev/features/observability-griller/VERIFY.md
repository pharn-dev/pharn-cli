# VERIFY — observability-griller

**VERIFIED: floor gates PASS.** Every deterministic gate exited 0 (`.dev/floor/check-verify.mjs` → `verdict: PASS`, exit 0).

- **Feature:** observability-griller (the fifth griller — `pharn-pipeline/grillers/observability/`).
- **Verifiers:** `count-verifiers .` → `{"registered":0}` — **no verifiers registered; floor gates only** (P7). Advisory layer is a no-op; the verdict is the floor gates alone.
- **`structural:trust-fence`** = `check-structural.mjs` over the one committed eval pair (trust-fence expected ↔ `.dev/features/trust-fence/findings.json`) — the feature ships no eval-actual pair of its own yet (no live griller runner — deferred P7), so no `structural:observability` gate exists; the griller's `*.test.*` (the scanner's hermetic suite, 11 tests) is collected by `npm test`.

**Precondition note (honest, P6):** this PASS required first repairing a **pre-existing HEAD breakage** unrelated to this increment — the concurrent `error-handling` session had committed `REVIEW/SHIP/VERIFY.md` trace files that failed `format:check` + `lint:md` (a latent pipeline bug: trace files are written after the style gates, so they were never style-checked, then committed unstyled). Those 3 files were repaired as a **separate** repo-hygiene pass (human-approved), not as part of this increment. Every failing gate was in those files; **zero** observability-increment files failed any gate.

**Honest residual:** verified = the named gates passed; this is NOT a guarantee of correctness beyond what those gates check — with zero verifiers, no advisory correctness signal was produced. The griller's actual runtime behavior over novel plans is model judgment, backstopped by its committed evals (checked at eval time), never a runtime guarantee.
