# VERIFY — comprehension-griller

**VERIFIED: floor gates PASS** (deterministic, `.dev/floor/check-verify.mjs` — exit 0). Every named gate
exited 0, run once at HEAD with the feature present.

## Floor layer — the gates (own the verdict)

| gate           | exit | meaning                                                                       |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test`         | 0    | `npm test` — 218/218 pass (incl. the hermetic `count-grillers` suite)         |
| `validate`     | 0    | `.dev/floor/validate.mjs .` GREEN — 13 capabilities, comprehension registered |
| `lint`         | 0    | `npm run lint` (eslint) clean                                                 |
| `format:check` | 0    | `npm run format:check` (prettier) clean                                       |
| `lint:md`      | 0    | `npm run lint:md` (markdownlint) clean                                        |

No `structural:<expected>` gate: the comprehension griller ships eval **expected** fixtures but **no
committed actual `findings.json`** (the live griller runner is deferred, P7 — same as all 11 sibling
grillers), so there is no committed eval-actual pair to check. This is the documented "feature shipping no
eval-actual pair has no `structural:*` gate" case.

## A format fix applied mid-verify (disclosed — this is the honest record)

The **first** `format:check` run returned **1**: prettier flagged two files I had just authored —
`pharn-pipeline/grillers/comprehension/comprehension.md` and `.dev/features/comprehension-griller/REGRESSION.md`
(prose-wrap / list normalization only). Both are **in this increment's declared scope** (the griller is in
the plan's `## Files`; `REGRESSION.md` is the regress artifact). I ran `prettier --write` on **exactly those
two files** — a deterministic, zero-judgment build-completion fix — confirmed the eval-pinned fixture line
(`plan-comprehension-debt.md:17`, `137 tokens/sec`) was **untouched**, and re-ran **all five gates**, which
then passed. The table above is the re-run. No gate was bypassed; the underlying issue (formatting) was
actually fixed, then the gate honestly passed.

## Advisory layer — verifiers

**No verifiers registered — floor gates only.** `.dev/floor/count-verifiers.mjs .` →
`{"registered":0,"verifiers":[]}` (deterministic frontmatter membership, P5). Step 2 is a no-op; the
verdict is the floor gates alone. No verifier is authored speculatively (P7).

## Verdict

**VERIFIED: floor gates PASS.** Honest residual (P0/P7): _verified = the named gates passed; this is NOT a
guarantee of correctness beyond what those gates check._ The whole-repo gates confirm the repo is green
**with** the comprehension griller in it, and `validate` confirms it is a well-formed, eval-bound,
membership-counted griller — but "these gates passed" is **not** "the griller's advisory comprehension
judgment is good." That judgment is irreducible and, by design, advisory (the griller guarantees only its
own membership). Verifier concerns would be advisory help, not assurance — and there are none today. The
merge/fix/abandon decision is the human's at the post-review gate.
