# SHIP — testability-griller (gated `/pharn-dev-ship` roll-up)

Advisory roll-up of a **gated** `/pharn-dev-ship` run. `/pharn-dev-ship` adds **no** floor primitive: every
verdict below belongs to a sub-stage; running the stages in order is advisory orchestration. This is
**not** a self-issued "shipped", an approval, or a `PHARN ✓ reviewed` seal.

## Stages run, in order

| stage                | outcome                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/pharn-dev-plan`    | `PLAN.md` written → **GATE 1** approval halt → human **approved** ("run the pipeline")   |
| `/pharn-dev-grill`   | `GRILL.md` — advisory; 6 concerns (0 blocking-severity, 1 important, 5 minor); proceeded |
| `/pharn-dev-build`   | wrote the 11 `## Files`; ran the floor                                                   |
| `/pharn-dev-regress` | `regression-report.json` written                                                         |
| `/pharn-dev-verify`  | `verify-report.json` written                                                             |
| `/pharn-dev-review`  | `REVIEW.md` — advisory 4-lens review; **GATE 2** reached                                 |

**Run ended at GATE 2** (post-review human decision) — no RED-verdict STOP occurred.

## Structural verdicts read (verbatim — the floor-grade proceed/stop inputs)

- **`/pharn-dev-build`** → `node .dev/floor/validate.mjs .` **exit 0** (`FLOOR: GREEN — 2 capabilities`
  — trust-fence + the new testability griller). GREEN → proceeded.
- **`/pharn-dev-regress`** → `regression-report.json` `.verdict` = **`"no-regressions"`** (all outside gates
  `tests`/`validate`/`structural:trust-fence` 0→0; `escaped: []`, no fix #7 breach). → proceeded.
- **`/pharn-dev-verify`** → `verify-report.json` `.verdict` = **`"PASS"`** (every floor gate exit 0:
  `test`/`validate`/`lint`/`format:check`/`lint:md`/`structural:trust-fence`; `verifiers.registered: 0`
  — floor gates only). → proceeded.

Each verdict is the sub-stage's own deterministic checker (`validate` exit / `check-regress` /
`check-verify`); `/pharn-dev-ship` only **read** them (advisory orchestration — the two-clocks split).

## Pointers (cited, not restated — P4)

- **`.dev/features/testability-griller/REVIEW.md`** — advisory 4-lens review: **GREEN, 0 blocking
  floor-findings** (lens + floor agree); advisory notes are honesty/coverage + a deferred live
  measurement, not defects.
- **`.dev/features/testability-griller/GRILL.md`** — advisory interrogation (the 3 build-time spec gaps it
  raised — absence `file`, present-case emission, `writes:`/emission — were resolved during
  `/pharn-dev-build`).
- Machine reports: `regression-report.json`, `verify-report.json`.

## Standing decision — the human's (GATE 2)

The chain ran; the named floor verdicts are as shown (`validate` GREEN · regress `no-regressions` ·
verify `PASS`) and the advisory review is GREEN. **This is NOT a judgment that the increment is good or
wise; that is the human's call at the post-review gate** — merge / fix / abandon. `/pharn-dev-ship` does not
merge, push, or seal.
