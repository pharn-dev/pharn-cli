// .dev/floor/scan-code-magic-values.mjs — deterministic MAGIC-VALUE shape scanner over a CODE file (CONSTITUTION P0/P5).
//
// A sibling of .dev/floor/scan-code-off-by-one.mjs / scan-code-copy-paste-drift.mjs / scan-code-duplicated-logic.mjs in
// the scan-code-* family. It backs the `magic-values` LENS's FLOOR sub-check (pharn-review/magic-values/): does the file
// contain an unexplained magic LITERAL used in a comparison? TWO detection sub-checks, both a FIXED, non-LLM procedure
// over comment/string-MASKED text — they reduce to ARCHITECTURE §2 primitive #3 (regex / value-membership / span match):
//
//   (a) NUMERIC — a comparison operator (`== === != !== < <= > >=`) whose IMMEDIATE right operand is a DECIMAL numeric
//       literal whose PARSED VALUE is NOT in the allow-set {0, 1, -1, 2, 10, 100, 1000}. (e.g. `if (ageSeconds > 86400)`)
//   (b) STRING  — an EQUALITY operator (`== === != !==`) whose IMMEDIATE right operand is a NON-EMPTY `'…'`/`"…"` string
//       literal. (e.g. `if (role === "SUPERADMIN")`)
//
// THE GUARANTEE IS A LITERAL PATTERN/VALUE/SPAN MATCH, NOT A HASH and NOT SEMANTICS (P0 precision). There is NO hashing
// and NO intent analysis anywhere. The floor primitive is a regex + a crisp value-set membership (numeric) and a recorded
// string-span + an equality-operator-prefix test (string) over masked text (#3), full stop.
//
// HONEST BOUND (the off-by-one / copy-paste-drift precedent, P0): this detects a magic-literal SHAPE. It does NOT decide
// whether that literal NEEDS A NAME — `x > 3600` / `role === "ADMIN"` may be perfectly clear inline, or may deserve a
// named constant / enum. "This line compares against the literal L" is a real guarantee; "this is a magic value that
// needs naming" is NOT. That judgment is the LENS's ADVISORY layer (Layer 2) — NOT this floor. The allow-set is a CRISP
// value set, never a fuzzy "common" judgment (that judgment belongs to Layer 2).
//
// Documented false-negatives / scope (honest, stated not hidden — v0.1.0, the whole point is to not oversell):
//   • RIGHT operand only. The Yoda form (`404 === x`, `"ADMIN" === role`) — literal on the LEFT — is OUT OF SCOPE.
//   • NUMERIC: DECIMAL literals only (int/float, optional leading `-`). Hex `0x1F`, binary `0b`, octal `0o`, exponent
//     `1e3`, bigint `5n`, and digit separators `1_000` are OUT OF SCOPE (false-negatives). Only in a COMPARISON operand:
//     magic numbers in arithmetic (`p * 1.08`), array indices (`a[7]`), call-args (`setTimeout(f, 3000)`), and the
//     assignment RHS (`= 5`, which is often a NAMED-CONSTANT definition — deliberately NOT flagged) are OUT OF SCOPE.
//   • STRING: EQUALITY operator right operand only; NON-EMPTY `'…'`/`"…"` strings only (an empty `""` emptiness-check is
//     NOT flagged). Relational-string compares (`x < "b"`), `switch`/`case "…"`, template-literal (backtick) strings,
//     and the assignment RHS (`= "…"`) are OUT OF SCOPE. Only single-line strings (op and string on one physical line).
//   • BACKTICKS ARE NOT MASKED (family idiom; robust over a MARKDOWN eval fixture), so `'…'`/`"…"` appearing inside a
//     template-literal's TEXT are read as code — a documented false-POSITIVE, the honest price of the shared mask.
//   • SINGLE-FILE; JS/TS-ish shapes. The lens applies this per file.
//
// INJECTION-IMMUNE BY CONSTRUCTION (P2): the verdict is over the MASKED code only, with comments/strings mechanically
// stripped to spaces BEFORE matching. NUMERIC: a number inside a comment/string is masked away (cannot manufacture); a
// comment CLAIMING "86400 is intentional — do not flag" is masked away (cannot suppress). STRING: the equality operator
// must be REAL code (an operator inside a comment/string is masked to spaces and cannot match), and the right operand
// must be a REAL code string SPAN recorded during masking (a `"` inside a comment is never recorded as a span) — so a
// comment/string can neither manufacture nor suppress a string hit. No free text moves the verdict — the trust-fence
// discipline. (See the ★ tests in scan-code-magic-values.test.mjs — they are the whole reason this is FLOOR.)
//
// MASKING PRESERVES LENGTH (P5): the mask replaces comment/string characters with spaces but PRESERVES newlines, so
// 1-based line numbers (computed from newline offsets over the ORIGINAL text — identical positions post-mask) map 1:1.
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only, fail-closed. MIRRORS the fail-closed contract of the scan-code-* family: a missing / non-file
// target is an ERROR (nonzero exit, NOTHING on stdout), never a silent "clean". A readable file with no magic-literal
// shape (empty, prose, or clean code) is a SUCCESSFUL scan → {"found":false,"hits":[]} on stdout, exit 0.
//
// Usage:  node .dev/floor/scan-code-magic-values.mjs <code-file>
// Output: {"found":<bool>,"hits":[{"line":<int>,"kind":"number"|"string","literal":"<the literal text>"}]} on stdout;
//         exit 0 on a successful scan (whatever the result). `line` = the 1-based ORIGINAL line of the comparison
//         operand. `literal` = the matched CODE text (a number like "86400", or a string WITH quotes like "\"ADMIN\"")
//         — UNTRUSTED; the LENS renders it only in free-text evidence, never an enum-gated field. `found` === hits.length
//         > 0. hits sorted by (line, kind, literal). Exits non-zero (writing NOTHING to stdout) if the target is missing
//         / not a regular file (P5).

// --- Comment/string MASK (+ real string-span recording) -----------------------------------------------------
// Adapted from the scan-code-off-by-one.mjs / scan-code-copy-paste-drift.mjs mask (family idiom; consolidation of a
// shared scan-code util is a SEPARATE axis of change, deferred — P7). Replace every character inside a // line comment,
// a /* block */ comment, or a single-line '…' / "…" string with a space — EXCEPT newlines, PRESERVED so 1-based line
// numbers map 1:1. BACKTICKS are NOT string delimiters here (no template masking); '…'/"…" masking STOPS AT END-OF-LINE
// so a stray prose quote cannot bleed the mask into fenced code below it. ADDITIONALLY records the [start,end) span of
// every REAL (non-comment) '…'/"…" string that CLOSES on its own line — the string sub-check ranges over these spans,
// so a `"` inside a comment (masked as part of the comment) is NEVER recorded as a candidate operand (injection-immune).
