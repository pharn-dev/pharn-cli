// .dev/floor/scan-code-resource-leak.mjs — deterministic UNCLOSED-RESOURCE scanner over a CODE file (CONSTITUTION P0/P5).
//
// A sibling of .dev/floor/scan-code-null-deref.mjs / scan-code-swallowed-exception.mjs in the scan-code-* family.
// Where those back the null-deref / swallowed-exception LENSes' FLOOR sub-checks, this one backs the
// `resource-leak` LENS's FLOOR sub-check (pharn-review/resource-leak/): a resource BOUND from a known
// open/connect/stream acquisition API whose binding is never cleaned up — no close call on the binding, not a
// `using` (RAII) declaration. Detection is a FIXED, non-LLM procedure: a comment/string MASK, a binding-assignment
// regex over a FIXED acquisition-method set, a paren-match of the acquisition call, and a FIXED cleanup-method
// membership test on the BOUND NAME. It reduces to ARCHITECTURE §2 primitive #3 (regex / enum / text membership).
//
// THE SHAPE (obvious cases only): `const|let|var NAME = [await] (recv.)*OPEN( … )` where OPEN is a fixed
// acquisition-method set. A HIT iff, in the masked text AFTER the binding, NAME is NEVER the receiver of a cleanup
// call (`NAME.close(` / `.end(` / `.destroy(` / …) and NEVER an argument of a cleanup call (`fs.closeSync(NAME)`),
// AND the declaration is not a `using` / `await using` binding (which auto-disposes, RAII). This is BINDING-ANCHORED
// like null-deref — the cleanup test matches the SPECIFIC binding token (`NAME.close(`), NOT a bare word (`close`)
// that prose could supply. Binding-anchoring PLUS masking template-literal string content in the SUPPRESSION copy
// (maskTemplateInteriors) is what makes it prose-robust and injection-immune: no free text — a comment OR a
// backtick literal — can supply a fake `NAME.close(`.
//
// SCOPE, STATED PRECISELY (P0 — the null-deref honesty): the absence test is FILE-LEVEL and NAME-TRACKED — "no
// cleanup of NAME anywhere in THIS file, after the binding." It is NOT lexical block/function-scope analysis and
// NOT ownership/control-flow analysis. "This file binds a resource from the fixed API set and never cleans that
// binding up in-file" is a real guarantee; "the resource leaks" / "no resource leaks" is NOT.
//
// HONEST BOUND (the null-deref / swallowed-exception precedent, P0 — false neg/pos, stated not hidden):
//   • LANGUAGE / SHAPE SCOPE: JS/TS `const|let|var|using NAME = [await] (recv.)*OPEN(` shapes only. A bare
//     `fs.openSync(p)` with NO binding, a resource opened AFTER construction (`const c = new Client(); c.connect()`
//     — the OPEN is not in the initializer), a Python `open()`, or a destructured bind → found:false — a scope
//     limit, NOT a "clean" verdict.
//   • FIXED OPEN SET { open, openSync, createReadStream, createWriteStream, createConnection, connect,
//     createStream, createSocket }: a custom acquirer (`pool.acquire()`, `new Database()`) is a false-negative
//     (deferred to the advisory layer / a future increment, P7). The bare broad names `open`/`connect`/
//     `createStream` (optional receiver) can over-match a non-resource `const modal = open(...)` → a HIT the
//     advisory layer owns ("is this actually a resource / does close happen elsewhere?").
//   • FIXED CLEANUP SET { close, closeSync, end, destroy, disconnect, release }: a custom disposer
//     (`dispose(res)`, `res.free()`) is not recognized → the binding reads as unclosed (a HIT the advisory layer
//     owns). Conversely, `end` is treated as closing (stream/socket semantics). `unref()` is deliberately NOT in
//     the set — it de-refcounts a handle from the event loop, it does NOT close/dispose it, so an unref'd-but-
//     never-closed resource is correctly still flagged (a resource-leak review finding, addressed).
//   • A bare `finally` block is NOT itself cleanup — only a detected cleanup CALL on the binding counts. A
//     try/finally whose finally does not close THIS binding (an empty finally, or one that closes a different
//     object) still flags the open. (Correct, but noted: the `finally` keyword carries no weight; the close call
//     on NAME does.)
//   • ARGUMENT-FORM CLEANUP is lenient: `(close|end|destroy|…)( … NAME … )` counts NAME appearing ANYWHERE in a
//     cleanup call's args as cleanup, so `end(wrap(NAME))` (which merely READS NAME) reads as CLEAN — a
//     false-negative in the conservative (under-flagging) direction, acceptable for an advisory lens.
//   • NOT SCOPE-AWARE: a same-named shadow binding, a `NAME.close()` in an unrelated branch, `obj.NAME.close()`
//     (a property that shares the name), or a `}` / `)` inside a template/regex literal in the scanned span can
//     skew the result. THIS IS NOT OWNERSHIP / CONTROL-FLOW ANALYSIS.
//   • Only `//`, `/* */` comments and single-line '…' / "…" strings are masked FOR DETECTION; a BACKTICK
//     template literal is left intact there — deliberately, so DETECTION is ROBUST over a MARKDOWN eval fixture
//     (```-fenced code + inline `code` prose), exactly as the sibling scanners are. The SUPPRESSION clause
//     additionally masks template-literal STRING content over a second copy (maskTemplateInteriors), so backtick
//     text cannot silence a real unclosed binding. Quote-masking stops at end-of-line, so a stray
//     apostrophe/quote in surrounding prose cannot bleed into the fenced code.
//
// INJECTION-IMMUNE BY CONSTRUCTION (P2): DETECTION is regex + paren-match + fixed-set membership over the
// comment/string-MASKED text, with template literals left INTACT so it survives ```-fenced markdown fixtures.
// The SUPPRESSION clause (isCleanedUp) runs over a SECOND copy in which template-literal STRING content is ALSO
// masked (see maskTemplateInteriors). So no free text — a // or /* */ comment, a single/double-quoted string, OR
// a template-literal's text — can manufacture a `NAME.close(` and suppress a real unclosed binding; a comment
// CLAIMING a leak over a binding that IS closed cannot manufacture a hit. The suppression masking is MONOTONE: it
// only ADDS masking to the suppression copy (a SUPERSET of what `masked` blanks) and never touches detection's
// `masked`, so the fix strictly NARROWS the laundering surface, never widens it, and can only over-flag. No
// SINGLE-backtick template-literal string content — the V1/V2 attack surface — can manufacture a `NAME.close(`.
// DOCUMENTED RESIDUAL (the price of fence-robustness): a run of ≥3 backticks is a MARKDOWN CODE-FENCE marker, so a
// ≥3-backtick-wrapped token is read as CODE — correct over a .md fixture (fenced content IS the code under
// review), a narrow residual in raw .js (the invalid 3-adjacent-template form), far narrower than the pre-fix
// any-backtick hole. Within that boundary the suppression search is injection-immune by construction. (See the ★
// tests in scan-code-resource-leak.test.mjs — the backtick-laundering immunity case AND the ≥3-backtick residual
// bound — the whole reason this is FLOOR, not judgment.)
//
// Single-file by contract (v0.1.0): scans ONE code file, mirroring the sibling scanners' <code-file> arg. A
// multi-file / directory sweep, cross-file close tracking, and real ownership analysis are FUTURE increments
// (P7 — not built speculatively); the lens applies this scanner per file today and surfaces the rest as advisory.
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only, fail-closed. MIRRORS the fail-closed contract of the sibling scanners: a missing /
// non-file target is an ERROR (nonzero exit, NOTHING on stdout), never a silent "clean".
//
// Usage:  node .dev/floor/scan-code-resource-leak.mjs <code-file>
// Output: {"found":<bool>,"hits":[{"line":<int>,"kind":"unclosed-resource"},...]} on stdout; exit 0 on a
//         successful scan (whatever the result). `found` === (hits.length > 0); hits sorted by line. `line` is the
//         BINDING (acquisition) line — the fix site where a close / finally / using belongs — never a comment line.
//         Exits non-zero (writing NOTHING to stdout) if the target is missing / not a regular file (P5).

// hidden in a comment or single-line string does not. Same single-pass mini-lexer as scan-code-null-deref.mjs
// (accepted, deferred duplication of the shared idiom — consolidation is a separate axis, P7).
//
// Two deliberate choices make this ROBUST OVER A MARKDOWN eval fixture (```-fenced code + inline `code` prose):
//   • BACKTICKS are NOT string delimiters here (no template masking) — otherwise markdown fences/inline code
//     would be read as unterminated template literals and mask the real code.
//   • '…' / "…" masking STOPS AT END-OF-LINE (a JS single/double-quoted string never spans a raw newline), so a
//     stray apostrophe/quote in surrounding prose cannot bleed the mask into the fenced code below it.

// --- Suppression-only template-interior MASK ----------------------------------------------------------------
// DETECTION (ASSIGN_RE + matchDelim, below) runs over `masked` with template literals INTACT, so it survives
// ```-fenced code in a MARKDOWN eval fixture. But the SUPPRESSION clause (isCleanedUp) must NOT read a template
// literal's STRING content as code — otherwise untrusted backtick text supplies a fake `NAME.close(` and
// silences a real unclosed binding (taint laundering INTO the enum-gated verdict, P2). So the suppression clause
// runs over THIS second copy, in which template-literal interiors are ALSO blanked. Two rules keep detection
// fence-robust:
//   • a RUN OF ≥3 BACKTICKS is a MARKDOWN CODE-FENCE marker → emitted unchanged, NOT a template delimiter (this
//     preserves the real code that lives BETWEEN ```-fences; a naive "blank everything between backticks" masker
//     would blank the whole fenced block and break detection — the ≥3-run skip is load-bearing);
//   • a SINGLE backtick toggles template state; inside a template every char is blanked to a space (newline
//     preserved). A run of exactly TWO backticks (``) is therefore an EMPTY template (open then immediate close)
//     — no interior, nothing masked.
// ${…} interpolation is blanked along with the surrounding string (Option A): the honest price is a documented
// false-POSITIVE if a cleanup call were written inside ${…} — over-flagging is the SAFE direction for an
// advisory-backing floor, mirroring the sibling scanners that read template TEXT as code. MONOTONICITY (P0/P2):
// this pass only ever ADDS masking to the SUPPRESSION copy; DETECTION reads the untouched `masked`, so no crafted
// backtick input can REMOVE masking to re-enable suppression — the fix can only over-flag, never launder. Length
// + newlines are preserved 1:1, so offsets map back to `masked`.
