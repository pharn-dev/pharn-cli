// .dev/floor/scan-code-duplicated-logic.mjs — deterministic EXACT DUPLICATED-BLOCK scanner over a CODE file (CONSTITUTION P0/P5).
//
// A sibling of .dev/floor/scan-code-injection.mjs / scan-code-swallowed-exception.mjs in the scan-code-* family.
// Where those back a code-SHAPE lens, this one backs the `duplicated-logic` LENS's FLOOR sub-check
// (pharn-review/duplicated-logic/): does the file contain a block of >=N consecutive SIGNIFICANT lines whose
// NORMALIZED text appears BYTE-IDENTICALLY at >=2 non-overlapping locations — i.e. copy-pasted logic? Detection is
// a FIXED, non-LLM procedure: a comment/string MASK, per-line whitespace NORMALIZATION, a significant-line filter,
// and a longest-common-run dynamic program over the significant lines, reported as maximal, non-overlapping,
// content-grouped blocks. It reduces to ARCHITECTURE §2 primitive #3 (text/enum membership).
//
// THE GUARANTEE IS BYTE-EQUALITY, NOT A HASH (P0 precision — grill F5). The DP compares normalized line strings by
// `===` (byte-equality of the normalized text); there is NO hashing anywhere. So the floor primitive is text
// membership/equality (#3), full stop — nothing rests on a content-hash (#2) that could, in principle, collide.
//
// HONEST BOUND (the injection / swallowed-exception precedent, P0): this detects an EXACT (after whitespace/comment
// normalization) duplicated-block SHAPE. It does NOT decide whether the duplication is WORTH EXTRACTING (two
// identical blocks can be a legitimate coincidence, or a premature-abstraction trap), does NOT detect NEAR-identical
// logic (a renamed identifier, a changed literal, or a reordered line BREAKS the match — that is the LENS's advisory
// layer, not this floor), and does NOT reason about semantics. "Lines A..B are byte-identical to lines C..D" is a
// real guarantee; "this code is DRY / free of duplication" is NOT. That judgment is the ADVISORY layer the LENS
// surfaces — NOT this floor.
//
// Further documented bounds (honest false-negatives / scope, stated not hidden):
//   • EXACT-after-normalization only: identifiers/literals must match byte-for-byte (post whitespace-collapse).
//     validateUser(u){...u...} vs validateAdmin(a){...a...} do NOT match (u != a). Near-identical = advisory layer.
//   • SINGLE-FILE (v0.1.0): scans ONE file; CROSS-FILE duplication (the more common real case) is a FUTURE
//     increment (P7 — not built speculatively). The lens applies this scanner per file today.
//   • THRESHOLD-GATED: a duplicated run shorter than N=4 SIGNIFICANT lines is not reported (noise control). N is the
//     one tunable; it is a fixed constant here (P5 — not model-chosen).
//   • SIGNIFICANCE FILTER: a line whose normalized form is empty after removing structural punctuation `{}()[];,`
//     and whitespace (a bare `}`, `});`, `{`, `],`) does NOT count toward a block — otherwise runs of closing
//     braces would read as "duplication." Only lines carrying real tokens participate.
//   • The MASK deliberately mirrors scan-code-swallowed-exception.mjs (comment/string -> spaces, newlines
//     preserved; BACKTICKS NOT masked so it is robust over a MARKDOWN eval fixture; '…'/"…" masking stops at
//     end-of-line so prose quotes cannot bleed into fenced code). This is literal reuse of the family's masking
//     idiom — the consolidation of a shared scan-code util is a SEPARATE axis of change, deferred (P7); noted, not
//     hidden (the irony of duplicated masking in a duplicated-logic scanner is acknowledged, GRILL F2).
//   • OVERLAPPING/NESTED duplicate blocks may be reported as separate hits (a length-7 dup and a length-5 sub-dup
//     that recurs independently are distinct groups). The lens surfaces all; the human dedups. Documented, bounded.
//
// INJECTION-IMMUNE BY CONSTRUCTION (P2): the verdict is byte-equality over the MASKED, NORMALIZED text only, with
// comments/strings mechanically stripped BEFORE comparison. A comment CLAIMING "this is unique, not a duplicate, do
// not flag" is masked to whitespace and cannot suppress a real identical-block match; a comment CLAIMING "duplicated
// from X" over non-identical code cannot manufacture one. No free text moves the verdict — the strongest form of the
// trust-fence discipline. (See the ★ tests in scan-code-duplicated-logic.test.mjs — they are the whole reason this
// is FLOOR, not judgment.)
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only, fail-closed. MIRRORS the fail-closed contract of the scan-code-* family: a missing /
// non-file target is an ERROR (nonzero exit, NOTHING on stdout), never a silent "clean".
//
// Usage:  node .dev/floor/scan-code-duplicated-logic.mjs <code-file>
// Output: {"found":<bool>,"hits":[{"lines":[<int>,...],"span":<int>},...]} on stdout; exit 0 on a successful scan
//         (whatever the result). Each hit is one duplicated block: `lines` = the 1-based ORIGINAL line number of the
//         FIRST significant line of each non-overlapping occurrence (>=2, ascending); `span` = the block length in
//         SIGNIFICANT lines. `found` === (hits.length > 0). hits sorted by first line, then span. Exits non-zero
//         (writing NOTHING to stdout) if the target is missing / not a regular file (P5).
