// .dev/floor/scan-plan-observability.mjs — deterministic observability-VOCABULARY presence scanner over a
// plan file (CONSTITUTION P0/P5).
//
// Answers ONE structural question for the observability griller's FLOOR sub-check: which lines of the plan
// TEXT contain an observability-vocabulary token — logging, metrics, tracing/spans, monitoring, telemetry,
// alerting, dashboards, instrumentation, "observability" itself, or SLO/SLI? Detection is a FIXED,
// word-boundary-anchored REGEX SET over the file's lines — non-LLM, no judgment. It reduces to
// ARCHITECTURE §2 primitive #3 (regex / enum check). MIRRORS the fail-closed contract + shape of
// .dev/floor/scan-plan-secrets.mjs (cite, don't restate — P4).
//
// HONEST BOUND (P0 — the crux; this is why the observability griller is a PARTIAL floor, not security's):
// this detects a vocabulary TOKEN's PRESENCE + line. It does NOT decide (a) that the plan NEEDS
// observability — "operationally significant" is judgment; (b) that a present token is REAL / ADEQUATE /
// for what the plan builds vs incidental, hollow, or injected; (c) that the plan "is observable". "Detected
// an observability-vocabulary token" is a real, deterministic datum; "the plan is observable" is not.
//
// POLARITY IS INVERTED vs scan-plan-secrets, AND THAT MATTERS (P0). A secret's PRESENCE is the concern, so
// scan-plan-secrets' hit FIRES a suppression-immune FLOOR finding. Here the concern is ABSENCE, so a hit is
// GOOD and *suppresses* a concern — which means a needle CAN flip `mentions:true` (an injected
// "metrics+tracing covered" comment genuinely contains those tokens). Therefore this scanner is NOT
// injection-immune in the direction that matters, and the observability griller treats its output as
// ADVISORY token-presence EVIDENCE (deterministic line numbers + a presence/absence datum) — NEVER a
// floor-gate or a suppressor. Dressing this launderable "present" verdict as floor would be the exact
// disease P0 forbids (the error-handling griller rejects precisely that). See observability.md's guarantee
// audit for the full reconciliation.
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only, fail-closed. MIRRORS the fail-closed contract of .dev/floor/scan-plan-secrets.mjs:
// a missing / non-file target is an ERROR (nonzero exit, NOTHING on stdout), never a silent "no mentions".
//
// Usage:  node .dev/floor/scan-plan-observability.mjs <plan-file>
// Output: {"mentions":<bool>,"hits":[{"line":<int>,"term":"<term-kind>"},...]} on stdout; exit 0 on a
//         successful scan (whatever the result). `mentions` === (hits.length > 0); hits sorted by line, then
//         term. Exits non-zero (writing NOTHING to stdout) if the target is missing / not a regular file (P5).

// The fixed observability-vocabulary set. Each entry is a deterministic, WORD-BOUNDARY-anchored regex + a
// stable `term` label. Adding or removing a term is the ONLY axis of change here (P3). Word boundaries keep
// high-signal: `\blog...\b` does not fire inside "changelog" / "login" / "blog" / "catalog" / "dialog", and
// `\btrac(e|es|ing)\b` does not fire inside "traceback" / "retrace" (proven by the ★ false-positive tests).
// This is a vocabulary PRESENCE detector, NOT an adequacy judge (see HONEST BOUND above).
