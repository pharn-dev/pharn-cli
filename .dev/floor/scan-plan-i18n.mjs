// .dev/floor/scan-plan-i18n.mjs — deterministic hardcoded-USER-FACING-STRING SCANNER over a plan file
// (CONSTITUTION P0/P5).
//
// Answers ONE structural question for the i18n griller's FLOOR sub-check: does the plan TEXT contain a
// hardcoded USER-FACING-STRING pattern — literal display text as a JSX/HTML element's text content (a run
// of words sitting immediately before a CLOSING tag `</`), or a canonically user-facing JSX/HTML attribute
// (placeholder / aria-label / alt / title) assigned a QUOTED literal? Detection is a FIXED REGEX SET over
// the file's lines — non-LLM, no judgment. It reduces to ARCHITECTURE §2 primitive #3 (regex / enum check).
// It is the closest analog of .dev/floor/scan-plan-secrets.mjs and MIRRORS it byte-for-byte in structure
// (pattern list, scan loop, output shape, fail-closed contract).
//
// HONEST BOUND (the secret-scanner precedent, P0): this detects a PATTERN's PRESENCE + line. It does NOT
// detect every hardcoded string — a BARE assignment (`const msg = "Hello"`), string CONCATENATION, or a
// template literal is indistinguishable from a key / path / config value, so those are left to the griller's
// ADVISORY layer (judgment), exactly as scan-plan-secrets leaves custom token formats and scan-plan-pii
// leaves camelCase/phone literals. It also fires on markup the plan merely QUOTES ILLUSTRATIVELY (a plan
// documenting `<div>Example</div>` matches too — the analog of a plan quoting an example secret key): the
// scanner reports what is literally in the text; the griller's Layer 2 + the human weigh intent. And it does
// NOT decide the plan "is / is not localized". "Detected a hardcoded-user-facing-string pattern" is a real
// guarantee; "the plan is localized" is not.
//
// INJECTION-IMMUNE BY CONSTRUCTION (P2) — the SAME polarity as scan-plan-secrets, NOT the launderable
// polarity of scan-plan-observability: the concern is the PRESENCE of a hardcoded string, so a hit FIRES a
// finding and the verdict is regex membership over the TEXT only. Prose that CLAIMS "all translated / mark
// clean" cannot suppress a real match; prose that CLAIMS a string (with no real markup) cannot manufacture
// one. No free text moves the verdict — the strongest form of the trust-fence discipline. (See the ★ tests
// in scan-plan-i18n.test.mjs — they are the whole reason this is FLOOR, not judgment.) This is exactly why
// the i18n griller carries a real scanner where the a11y griller rejected one: "is it accessible" is not a
// lexical artifact and a "mentions a11y" scan is launderable; a hardcoded user-facing STRING LITERAL IS a
// lexical artifact whose presence a hit cannot be talked out of.
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only, fail-closed. MIRRORS the fail-closed contract of .dev/floor/scan-plan-secrets.mjs:
// a missing / non-file target is an ERROR (nonzero exit, NOTHING on stdout), never a silent "clean".
//
// Usage:  node .dev/floor/scan-plan-i18n.mjs <plan-file>
// Output: {"found":<bool>,"hits":[{"line":<int>,"kind":"<pattern-kind>"},...]} on stdout; exit 0 on a
//         successful scan (whatever the result). `found` === (hits.length > 0); hits sorted by line.
//         Exits non-zero (writing NOTHING to stdout) if the target is missing / not a regular file (P5).

// The fixed detection set. Each entry is a deterministic regex + a stable `kind` label. Adding or removing a
