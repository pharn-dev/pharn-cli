// .dev/floor/scan-plan-migrations.mjs — deterministic migration/rollback-VOCABULARY presence scanner over a
// plan file (CONSTITUTION P0/P5).
//
// Answers ONE structural question for the migrations griller's FLOOR sub-check: which lines of the plan TEXT
// contain a migration/rollback-DECLARATION vocabulary token — migration/migrate, rollback / roll back,
// revert, reversible/irreversible, or backfill? Detection is a FIXED, word-boundary-anchored REGEX SET over
// the file's lines — non-LLM, no judgment. It reduces to ARCHITECTURE §2 primitive #3 (regex / enum check).
// MIRRORS the fail-closed contract + shape of .dev/floor/scan-plan-observability.mjs (cite, don't restate — P4).
//
// HONEST BOUND (P0 — the crux; this is why the migrations griller is a PARTIAL floor, not security's): this
// detects a declaration-vocabulary TOKEN's PRESENCE + line. It does NOT decide (a) that the plan TOUCHES a
// schema / persisted-data shape — "touches schema" is judgment (a plan can reshape persisted data via an ORM
// model, a JSON blob, or a NoSQL doc with no lexical "ALTER TABLE"); (b) that a present token is a REAL /
// ADEQUATE / SAFE migration for what the plan builds vs incidental, hollow, or injected; (c) that the plan's
// schema change is reversible. "Detected a migration-vocabulary token" is a real, deterministic datum;
// "the migration is safe / reversible" is not. This scanner detects the DECLARATION vocabulary (whose ABSENCE
// is the concern) — NOT the schema-touching TRIGGER (which is the griller's advisory judgment).
//
// POLARITY IS INVERTED vs scan-plan-secrets, AND THAT MATTERS (P0). A secret's PRESENCE is the concern, so
// scan-plan-secrets' hit FIRES a suppression-immune FLOOR finding. Here the concern is ABSENCE (a schema
// change with no declared migration/rollback), so a hit is GOOD and *suppresses* a concern — which means a
// needle CAN flip `mentions:true` (an injected "migration + rollback covered" comment genuinely contains
// those tokens). Therefore this scanner is NOT injection-immune in the direction that matters, and the
// migrations griller treats its output as ADVISORY token-presence EVIDENCE (deterministic line numbers + a
// presence/absence datum) — NEVER a floor-gate or a suppressor. Dressing this launderable "present" verdict
// as floor would be the exact disease P0 forbids (the error-handling griller rejects precisely that; the
// observability griller reconciles it identically). See migrations.md's guarantee audit.
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only, fail-closed. MIRRORS the fail-closed contract of .dev/floor/scan-plan-observability.mjs:
// a missing / non-file target is an ERROR (nonzero exit, NOTHING on stdout), never a silent "no mentions".
//
// Usage:  node .dev/floor/scan-plan-migrations.mjs <plan-file>
// Output: {"mentions":<bool>,"hits":[{"line":<int>,"term":"<term-kind>"},...]} on stdout; exit 0 on a
//         successful scan (whatever the result). `mentions` === (hits.length > 0); hits sorted by line, then
//         term. Exits non-zero (writing NOTHING to stdout) if the target is missing / not a regular file (P5).

// The fixed migration/rollback-DECLARATION vocabulary set. Each entry is a deterministic, WORD-BOUNDARY-anchored

// (proven by the ★ false-positive tests), and `\brevert…\b` does not fire inside "reverse" / "reverberate".
// This is a declaration-vocabulary PRESENCE detector, NOT a safety/adequacy judge (see HONEST BOUND above).
