// floor/check-structural.test.mjs — black-box tests for the deterministic structural checker.
//
// Run as a subprocess (mirrors validate.test.mjs) so check-structural.mjs keeps its dependency-free,
// top-level-exec contract: we assert only on its public surface (exit code + RED/GREEN stdout).
//
// The two ★ tests (needle-present, skill_kind=deterministic-with-semantic) are the ones that prove
// the thesis is ENFORCED, not decorative: an untrusted needle laundered into an enum-gated field,
// and a deterministic skill routing judgment through the advisory judge, are both deterministic REDs.
