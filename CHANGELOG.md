# Changelog

All notable changes to `pharn-cli` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repo-health tooling: `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub issue/PR templates, `CODEOWNERS`,
  Dependabot config, markdownlint for docs, an aggregate `npm run check` script, and
  an enforced test-coverage gate in CI.

### Changed

- Docs: surfaced the new optional `/pharn-spec` stage (intent capture before `/pharn-plan`) in
  getting-started and the `pharn-pipeline` module description, matching `pharn-oss`. No CLI code
  change — `/pharn-spec` ships transparently via the existing whole-module install from `main`.
- Docs: completed the getting-started day-to-day loop with `/pharn-regress` and refreshed the
  `pharn.config.json` example module versions to match the current `pharn-oss` manifest
  (`skillsVersion` 0.70.0).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-11

Realigned the CLI with the current `pharn-dev/pharn-oss`, which is now a
**module-based** repo (`pharn-core` + optional `pharn-pipeline`, `pharn-review`,
`pharn-audits`, and a `pharn-stack-nextjs` stack pack) described by a root
`manifest.json` and per-module `module.json` `installs` maps.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`pharn init` is now a module wizard.** It fetches the module catalog from
  `pharn-dev/pharn-oss`, then asks: which optional modules, which stack pack, and a
  privacy posture (constitution variant). It resolves dependencies + exclusivity from
  the manifest, clones the repo, copies each selected module's `installs` into
  `.claude/`, and materializes `memory-bank/` + the chosen `CONSTITUTION.md`. The old
  UI/db/auth/orm stack-scaffolder wizard and the vendor-skills consent flow were removed.
- **GitHub coordinates fixed** — `pharn/pharn` → `pharn-dev/pharn-oss`; first feature
  command `/ship-feature` → `/pharn-plan`.
- **`pharn.config.json` schema** — now records `skillsVersion`, `repo`, pinned `commit`,
  `constitution`, and the resolved `modules[]` (name + version), plus `installedAt`.

### Added

- **`pharn add <module>`** — adds a module (and its dependencies) to an existing project
  and updates `pharn.config.json`; never touches `CONSTITUTION.md`.
- **`pharn update`** — compares the pinned `skillsVersion`/module versions against the
  latest manifest, shows a diff, and re-fetches installed modules on confirmation.
- **Path-escape hardening** — module names, versions, and `installs` paths are validated
  against strict allowlists, and every copy is guarded by `safeJoin`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-11

Initial published release. `pharn-cli` bootstraps the PHARN stack into an existing
Next.js project. Exposes both `pharn` and `pharn-cli` bins.

### Added

- **`pharn init` wizard** — the default command. A `@clack/prompts` step pipeline that
  configures a stack and writes `pharn.config.json`:
  - **Prerequisite checks** — hard-fails if `next` isn't in `package.json` or the project
    isn't a git repository.
  - **Fresh-project check** — warns (via commit count and a custom-file heuristic) when the
    project isn't a fresh Next.js scaffold.
  - **Mode select** — `default-mode` (a canned stack) or `custom-mode` (the full wizard over
    every option defined in `src/types.ts`), followed by warnings and a summary the user can
    accept, cancel, or loop back to edit.
- **Skill installation** — clones the PHARN skills repo into `.claude/` via `degit`,
  prompting before overwriting an existing `.claude/` or `pharn.config.json`, then records
  `pharnVersion`, `skillsVersion`, and the chosen `stack` in `pharn.config.json`.
- **Vendor-skills flow** — fetches a remote, schema-versioned manifest, matches each vendor's
  `triggeredBy` features against the selected stack, shows commit-age hints, and presents an
  opt-in multiselect (nothing selected by default). Accepted/declined vendors are recorded
  under `vendorSkills`. Any network failure soft-fails and install proceeds.
- **Security-hardened remote input** — all remote strings (manifest, repo/branch/commit) are
  validated against strict regex allowlists, checked for `..` and control characters, and
  fetched with `redirect: 'error'`, an 8s timeout, and a 256KB body cap. The manifest
  `schemaVersion` must be exactly `1`.
- **`PHARN_DEBUG=1`** — surfaces full error output for skill-clone and vendor-manifest
  failures.
- **`pharn add` and `pharn update`** — stubbed; full behavior planned for a later release.

### Notes

- **v0.1 scope:** `init` only clones `.claude/` skills and serializes stack choices into
  `pharn.config.json`. It does not yet install npm packages or scaffold the stack — that is
  planned for v0.2 (see `docs/roadmap.md` and the `TODO(v0.2)` markers).
