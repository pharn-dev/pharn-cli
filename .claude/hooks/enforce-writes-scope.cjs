// .claude/hooks/enforce-writes-scope.cjs — pre-write floor (CONSTITUTION P0/P2/P5, fix #7).
//
// Deterministic, non-LLM, stdlib-only. A Claude Code PreToolUse hook (Write|Edit|MultiEdit) that
// DENIES (exit 2) any write whose path is outside the ACTIVE writes-scope. The active scope is the
// `scope[]` in .pharn/writes-scope.json (written by set-writes-scope.cjs from a declared `writes:`).
// FAIL-CLOSED: if that file is absent/invalid, only a default-safe-set is writable; everything else
// is denied. This makes ARCHITECTURE §3.1/§7's "`writes:` ENFORCED by the pre-write hook" TRUE.
//
// Symlink-safe: the target is canonicalized with fs.realpathSync BEFORE the scope test, so a write
// through a committed symlink is judged by its REAL target — a symlink onto a trusted doc or out of
// scope is denied, not laundered by an innocent-looking name. Residual: this resolves EXISTING symlink
// targets; a broken symlink (target absent) falls back to the lexical path — a narrow
// scope-escape-to-create, outside the reported committed-symlink vector and no worse than prior behavior.
//
// ADDITIVE to fix #2 (protect-trusted-paths.cjs): both hooks run on every write; a deny from EITHER
// blocks. fix #7 is scope-only and does NOT re-implement the trusted-doc denylist — fix #2 remains the
// hard backstop for CONSTITUTION/ARCHITECTURE/THREAT-MODEL/LIMITS + CODEOWNERS, regardless of scope.
// The allow/deny decision rests ONLY on path/glob membership (P2: never on a free-text/tainted field).
