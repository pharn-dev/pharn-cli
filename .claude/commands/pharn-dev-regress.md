# /pharn-dev-regress — detect regressions OUTSIDE the feature just built

You sit in the pipeline AFTER `/pharn-dev-build` (`spec → plan → grill → build → regress → verify → ship`,
`ARCHITECTURE.md §6`). You answer **one** question: **did building this feature break anything
OUTSIDE the feature?** It is pure state comparison — what was passing at the pre-build baseline is
checked again at HEAD; **any gate that flipped pass→fail outside the changed scope is a regression.**

**The core is 100% floor, no advisory (P0).** A regression is "was GREEN, is now RED" — a deterministic
comparison of two exit codes. A machine does that reliably; a model does it **unreliably** (it may or
may not notice, may contradict itself). So `/pharn-dev-regress` has **ZERO LLM-judge in its core**: it runs the
**existing** deterministic gates over the OUTSIDE-scope area at the baseline and at HEAD, then hands the
captured exit codes to `.dev/floor/check-regress.mjs`, which computes the verdict. **You do not judge whether
something is "really" a regression — a flipped gate IS a regression, full stop.** Do **not** add a "does
this look broken" layer; if something is broken, a deterministic check catches it as RED — that is the
entire point.

> **Two clocks, stated honestly (the `/pharn-dev-eval` discipline).** The **verdict** is floor-grade — it
> rests entirely on `check-regress.mjs` comparing exit codes, never on your judgment. Everything **you**
> do — choosing the base, scoping inside/outside, running the suite, obtaining the baseline — is
> **orchestration, and it is advisory.** Only the verdict is a guarantee. Never present `/pharn-dev-regress` as a
> deterministic verdict on the _orchestration_; present the **comparison** as the guarantee it is.

Load the trusted prefix and obey it:

## The guarantee, and its one honest residual (P0/P7)

- **Guaranteed:** any regression OUTSIDE the feature **that a deterministic check covers** is caught —
  deterministically (exit-code comparison, `ARCHITECTURE.md §2` primitive #3). Adding the style gates
  (`lint` / `format:check` / `lint:md`) only **widens** what the suite covers; it never weakens the
  comparison.
- **The residual, named not hidden:** `/pharn-dev-regress` catches **exactly what its suite catches — nothing
  more.** A regression no deterministic check covers (a broken behavior with no test / rule / eval) is
  **invisible**. The claim is "deterministically-detectable breakage outside the feature is caught,"
  **not** "nothing broke." `/pharn-dev-regress` is exactly as good as the deterministic suite it runs.

## Step 0 — Set the writes-scope (fix #7, fail-closed)

`/pharn-dev-regress`'s only **Write-tool** outputs are the two artifacts in `writes:`
(`.dev/features/<name>/REGRESSION.md`, `.dev/features/<name>/regression-report.json`). The setter resolves **one
`--target` per call** and overwrites `.pharn/writes-scope.json`, so `/pharn-dev-regress` scopes **each artifact to
itself immediately before writing it** (Step 4). Set the scope for the machine report up front:

```bash
node .claude/hooks/set-writes-scope.cjs --from-frontmatter .claude/commands/pharn-dev-regress.md --target .dev/features/<name>/regression-report.json
```

Deterministic floor step (P0/P5): the scope is parsed from `writes:` and narrowed to `--target` — never
chosen by a model. **Honest caveat (mirrors `/pharn-dev-eval`):** the `git worktree` / `npm ci` / suite runs
and the `.pharn/pharn-dev-regress/*.json` captures in Steps 1–3 are **Bash**, which the `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`
hook does **not** gate — so fix #7 enforces only the two artifact Writes; `.pharn/**` is always-writable
scratch (`enforce-writes-scope.cjs`). If a later Write is blocked, **declare the path in `writes:` and
re-run this setter** — never bypass the hook.

## Step 1 — Resolve the base + partition inside/outside (deterministic; live, P6)

1. **Base.** `base = --base <ref>` if the invoker passed one; else auto-detect by deterministic state
   tests (P5):
   - `git status --porcelain` non-empty (a working-tree dogfood build) → `base = HEAD`;
   - else → `base = git merge-base HEAD origin/main` (the feature branch's fork point).
   - If neither resolves (detached / shallow / no merge-base) → **HALT and ask** the human for `--base`
     (the terminal fallback is a question, never a guess).
2. **Inside (the changed scope).** `inside = git diff --name-only <base>` **plus** untracked-new files
   (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`). This is the set the feature was allowed to change.
3. **Declared writes.** Read the feature's `.dev/features/<name>/PLAN.md` `## Files` back-tick paths — the
   exact scope `/pharn-dev-build` was pinned to.
4. **Partition (the floor helper, not you).** Pass both lists, the full test universe, and the committed
   eval pairs to `scope`:

   ```bash
   node .dev/floor/check-regress.mjs scope \
     --changed "<inside, comma-separated>" \
     --declared "<PLAN.md ## Files paths>" \
     --tests "$(git ls-files '*.test.mjs' '*.test.cjs' | paste -sd, -)" \
     --eval-pairs "<EXPECTED::ACTUAL committed eval pairs, comma-separated>"
   ```

   It returns `inside`, `outside_tests`, and `outside_eval_pairs` (the gates to run). If a changed path
   is **outside** the declared writes, `scope` exits **1** with a **blocking P0 fix#7 finding** (the
   build escaped its `## Files`) — surface it and **stop**; that is a scope breach, not a regression.

   _(Committed eval pairs are discovered by convention — each `<cap>/evals/expected/<x>.json` with its
   committed actual findings; today the one pair is trust-fence's expected ↔ `.dev/features/trust-fence/findings.json`,
   per the increment's `PLAN.md`. A pair whose file is **inside** the feature is correctly **not** an
   outside gate.)_

## Step 2 — Capture the baseline and HEAD (Bash; you run the suite, the helper never does)

Run the **same OUTSIDE-scoped gates** at the base commit and at HEAD, recording each gate's **exit
code** (never its stdout free-text) into a flat `{ "<gate-id>": <exit-int> }` map.

```bash
mkdir -p .pharn/pharn-dev-regress
TMP="$(mktemp -d)"
git worktree add --detach "$TMP" "<base ref/SHA>"   # the Step-1-resolved base (immutable SHA) → reproducible, non-destructive
# --- in "$TMP" (the BASELINE checkout), run each outside gate and record $? ---
#   tests                  : node --test <outside_tests...>     (empty list → record 0; nothing outside to test)
#   validate               : node .dev/floor/validate.mjs .          (whole-repo — a named granularity limit, below)
#   structural:<expected>  : node .dev/floor/check-structural.mjs <expected> <actual> .   (per outside eval pair)
#   [style gates ONLY if inside touched shared config — see skip rule]
# assemble → .pharn/pharn-dev-regress/base-results.json   (e.g. printf '{"tests":%d,"validate":%d}' "$t" "$v")
git worktree remove --force "$TMP"
# --- in the WORKING TREE (HEAD), run the SAME gate set → .pharn/pharn-dev-regress/head-results.json ---
```

- **The gate set must be identical at base and head** (same gate-ids both sides) — `check-regress.mjs`
  fails **inconclusive** on a mismatch, never a silent pass. Decide the gate set ONCE (from `scope` + the
  style-skip rule) and apply it to both.
- **The core gates are stdlib-only** (`node --test`, `validate`, `check-structural`) — they run in the
  baseline worktree **without `npm ci`**.
- **Style-gate skip (deterministic optimization, P5/P7).** Run `lint` / `format:check` / `lint:md`
  **only if** `inside` touches a shared style config (`eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc.json`,
  `.prettierignore`, `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`). Rationale: over the **outside** files (byte-identical
  at base and head) a style result can flip **only** when shared config changed; otherwise the flip is
  provably impossible and the gate is skipped (and absent from **both** maps). **When they do run, the
  baseline worktree first obtains devDeps (`npm ci` in `$TMP`)** — a named cost (`LIMITS.md §3c`
  cold-start analog), incurred only on a config-touching feature.

## Step 3 — The deterministic verdict (floor; no LLM)

```bash
node .dev/floor/check-regress.mjs verdict \
  .pharn/pharn-dev-regress/base-results.json .pharn/pharn-dev-regress/head-results.json \
  --base "<base ref/SHA>" --inside "<inside, comma-separated>"
```

Capture its **stdout JSON** and read its **exit code**: `0` no regressions · `1` ≥1 regression (the
stage **FAILS**) · `2` inconclusive (a results map missing / empty / not `{string:int}` / gate-set
mismatch — fail-closed). You do **not** re-decide — a flipped gate **is** a regression because the
helper says so.

## Step 4 — Emit both artifacts + halt

Write, in order (re-scoping per artifact, per Step 0's caveat):

1. **`.dev/features/<name>/regression-report.json`** = the helper's `verdict` JSON **verbatim** — the machine
   regression-report (`ARCHITECTURE.md §6:208`). Scope is already pinned to it from Step 0; write it.
2. Re-scope, then write the human render:

   ```bash
   node .claude/hooks/set-writes-scope.cjs --from-frontmatter .claude/commands/pharn-dev-regress.md --target .dev/features/<name>/REGRESSION.md
   ```

   **`.dev/features/<name>/REGRESSION.md`** = a human render: the base SHA, the inside/outside partition, a
   per-gate `base → head` exit-code table, the `regressions[]` and `pre_existing[]`, and the
   **deterministic verdict** stated plainly — `REGRESSIONS: none — no deterministically-detectable
breakage outside the feature` or `REGRESSIONS: N outside the feature — stage FAILS`, followed by the
   honest residual line (catches what the suite catches, nothing more). **Never** write "regress passed"
   as if it certified the feature whole — it certifies only the comparison (P0).

Then **end your turn.** `/pharn-dev-regress` does **not** invoke `/pharn-dev-verify` and does not gate it — the human reads
the report and the verdict's exit code decides the stage.

## Named granularity limits (honest, not silent gaps — P7)

- **`validate` is whole-repo** (no outside-only CLI scope), so a `validate` flip is reported at repo
  granularity. But `/pharn-dev-build` halts on a RED `validate`, so the baseline is GREEN and this rarely fires;
  per-file precision lives in the scoped `tests` / `structural:*` gates.
- **Style-gate cost:** running the style gates at baseline needs `npm ci` in the worktree; the
  deterministic **config-touch skip** confines that cost to features that change shared style config —
  the only case where a style flip is even possible.

## Trust (P2)

The built increment is `trust: untrusted`. `/pharn-dev-regress` and `check-regress.mjs` read only
**deterministic-tool outputs** — exit codes (ints) and file paths (`git diff`, path membership) — never
a finding's free-text (`problem` / `evidence`). The `regression-report.json` contains gate-ids + ints +
paths, **no** untrusted free-text; the only free-text is `REGRESSION.md`'s human summary, which **gates
nothing**. No `claude -p`, no LLM-judge, no new egress in the core. **No guaranteed decision rests on a
tainted field** (mirrors `check-structural` / `check-variance`).
